## Description

This is one of my first projects, and it was the starting point for my journey into programming, especially front-end development. Although it may contain a few bugs due to its status as one of my earliest endeavors, I'm still proud of this work as it represents an important milestone in my growth as a developer.

## Principal Function

The main purpose of this project was to immerse myself in development practices through programming. Although it was a beginning and more of an aesthetic development made up of HTML and CSS, it was the first time I interacted with a code editor and programming parameters. In the commercial world, it would apply to the development of a website that provides information to a user about a specific place. However, as I mentioned earlier, it has a personal significance for me as it was my first encounter with the world of programming.
